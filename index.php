            <p>The following list of plugins were originally designed for the EtriaCraft server, however many of them have been released to the public. To keep an updated list of commands, I have made this little website for them.</p>
            <p>All of the projects listed below are open source, if you wish to use the source please give the original author (MistPhizzle) credit. Especially if you redistribute.</p>
            <p>I am open for suggestions / requests for any of the plugins. Use the link to the contact form at the end of the page if you need to reach me. I am also looking for skilled developers who could assist with this plugin.</p>
